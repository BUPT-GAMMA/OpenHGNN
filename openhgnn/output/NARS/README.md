## How to run

Clone the Openhgnn-DGL

```python
python main.py -m NARS -t node_classification -d acm4NARS -g 0 --use_best_config
```

Candidate dataset: acm4NARS

If you do not have gpu, set -gpu -1.

## candidate dataset

acm4NARS

NOTE: NARS can handle mag oag dataset, we will add these two datasets in our further work.

### model

- NARS

    NARS is composed of WeightedAggregator and SIGN.

- WeightedAggregator
    
    Get new features by multiplying the old features by the weight matrix.
    
- SIGN

    The MLP classifier. It is composed  of a several linear layers. Then project the node embeddings to the vector space to predict the type of the nodes.


## Hyper-parameter specific to the model

```python
R = 2
input_dropout = True
cpu_preprocess = True
ff_layer = 2
```

Best config can be found in [best_config](file:/E:/资料/科研/复现论文/OpenHGNN-main/openhgnn/utils/best_config.py)
